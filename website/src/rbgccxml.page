<h3>Synopsis</h3>

Rbgccxml is a C++ source code querying library. It makes use of 
<a href="http://www.gccxml.org">GCCXML</a> and 
<a href="http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/hpricot/">Hpricot</a> to process
the C++ code (currently only headers and not body code) into easy to read XML, then
opens up a very simple but powerful query API for searching everything about the code.

Rbgccxml is released under the <a href="http://github.com/jameskilton/rbgccxml/tree/master/MIT_LICENCE">MIT Licence</a>
