<h1>Rb++</h1>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>

Rb++ is a code generation system using <a href="rbgccxml.html">RbGCCXML</a> and 
<a href="http://rice.rubyforge.org" target="_blank">Rice</a> to make the creation
of Ruby extensions as easy as possible.

<h3>Documentation</h3>

View the projects RDocs <a href="rbplusplus/index.html">here</a>.

<h3>Example</h3>

To give an idea of how easy it is to wrap C++ libraries into Ruby extensions, we'll
go through the wrapping of the <a href="http://libnoise.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">
libnoise</a> library, a library built to easily generate coherent noise. 

This libnoise wrapper is a part of the under-development <a href="http://github.com/jameskilton/ogrerb/tree/master">Ogre.rb</a> library. The following code will only run under the Ogre.rb environment so feel free to check out the project and follow along.

We'll start by showing the full source code of the wrapper, which will then be broken down by each important
part.

<h4>First, the code</h4>

{includeFile: {filename: code/build_noise.rb, processOutput: false, escapeHTML: false, highlight: ruby}}

<br/>
At first glance, this is probably quite overwhelming, but it breaks down into two very easy-to-understand sections: <a href="#source">souce code / compilation setup</a> and <a href="#definitions">wrapping definitions</a>.

<a name="source"></a>
<h4>Source Code / Compliation Setup</h4>

{includeFile: {filename: code/build_noise.source.rb, processOutput: false, escapeHTML: false, highlight: ruby}}

<br/>
This section of the code constitutes the Setup portion of the wrapper. We'll go through each line to understand what all
is happening here.

<br/>
{includeFile: {filename: code/build_noise.1.rb, processOutput: false, escapeHTML: false, highlight: ruby}}

<br/>
All extensions start with this declaration. The string passed in will be the final name of the extension. In this case,
this will generate an extension named "noise.so".

<br/>
{includeFile: {filename: code/build_noise.2.rb, processOutput: false, escapeHTML: false, highlight: ruby}}

<br/>
The Working Directory is the place where all generated code is placed. By default, the Working Directory is "generated", local
to the ruby script. In the case that this is not sufficient, such as this wrapper, use this attribute to set another
directory. 

Please note that all directories used in the script should be full paths to prevent problems, though this is not required.

<br/>
{includeFile: {filename: code/build_noise.3.rb, processOutput: false, escapeHTML: false, highlight: ruby}}

<br/>
Here we have the bulk of the required setup for this wrapper to function properly. Extension#sources is the method that controls
configuration of what source code is to be wrapped, where such code is to be found, any extra code to be added to the extension,
and how compilation works (flags, etc). We'll go through each part on it's own.

<br/>
{includeFile: {filename: code/build_noise.3.1.rb, processOutput: false, escapeHTML: false, highlight: ruby}}

<br/>
The first argument to Extension#sources is the only one required. It is where you specify what source header files are to be
parsed for function / class / method definitions to wrap into an extension. Here, because libnoise gives us a "noise.h" file
that itself includes the rest of the headers, we only need to specify this one file. Noiseutils is a seperate, downloadable 
set of utility methods and classes that we also want to put in our extension, so we specify its header here as well.

*Note* For any and all places where file paths are expected, said paths can be in one of these forms:

* Straight string, like "/path/to/file.h"
* Glob, such as "/where/headers/are/&#42;.h"
* An array of strings ["/here/header1.h", "/there/header2.h", ...]
* An array of globs ["/usr/lib/library/&#42;.h", "/usr/lib/other_lib/&#42;.hpp"]

<br/>
{includeFile: {filename: code/build_noise.3.2.rb, processOutput: false, escapeHTML: false, highlight: ruby}}

<br/>
These three options map directly onto compiler flags.

* :include_paths are added to -I
* :library_paths are added to -L
* :libraries     are added to -l

If you are getting errors about GCCXML being unable to find certain source files, :include_paths helps with fixing
this as well.

<br/>
{includeFile: {filename: code/build_noise.3.3.rb, processOutput: false, escapeHTML: false, highlight: ruby}}

<br/>
This option is simply allowing you to specify extra C++ source files that need to be copied into the working directory and 
compiled in with the extension, but not necessarily parsed and wrapped. 

"custom_to_from_ruby.{c,h}pp" here is currently how you would handle any requirement of writing C++ wrapper code that rb++ doesn't
handle automatically. The contents of these files are on github:

* <a href="http://github.com/jameskilton/ogrerb/tree/master/wrappers/noise/code/custom_to_from_ruby.hpp">custom_to_from_ruby.hpp</a>
* <a href="http://github.com/jameskilton/ogrerb/tree/master/wrappers/noise/code/custom_to_from_ruby.cpp">custom_to_from_ruby.cpp</a>

In this case, there is some duplication between :include_source_files, the first argument of Extension#sources, and (further along
in this tutorial) :includes, which should be minimized in future versions of rb++. For now, the duplication is unfortunately
required for this wrapper to compile and run properly.

<br/>
{includeFile: {filename: code/build_noise.3.4.rb, processOutput: false, escapeHTML: false, highlight: ruby}}

<br/>
The final option given to Extension#sources fits in with :include_source_files above. When there's a header file that needs
to be included in all of the generated source files (such as custom_to_from_ruby.hpp), it must be specified with this
option. As said before, this will most likely made simplier and cleaner in the next release of rb++.

With this, Rb++ is fully configured to create an extension from C++ source code. However, because C++ features and standards and Ruby features and standards don't often match up, Rb++ makes available many tools for manipulating the resulting extension to fit the Ruby-way.

<a name="definitions"></a>
<h4>Wrapping Definitions</h4>

{includeFile: {filename: code/build_noise.definitions.rb, processOutput: false, escapeHTML: false, highlight: ruby}}

<br/>
The rest of the code handles defining the final Ruby extension. Rb++'s API is meant to be as simple and obvious as possible, 
though there are some nuances that need to be explained.

<br/>
{includeFile: {filename: code/build_noise.4.rb, processOutput: false, escapeHTML: false, highlight: ruby}}
