Parts to move into rbgccxml:

- Class purely_virtual? (check the abstract attribute)
- Namespace#methods ?

More command line arguments:
 - Debugging (-v?) to show (DEBUG) messages, only (INFO) and (WARNING) by default
 - Silent (-q -s?) to just not print anything out
 - Hide Warnings (-W ?) Warnings are there for a reason, but I can see people wanting to ignore them
