TODO
* Figure out how to fix the error when running rake test
* Allowing use of "have_library"

  - ArrayType
  - Converter
  - Destructor
  - Field
  - FunctionType
  - OperatorFunction
  - OperatorMethod

DONE
* Adding -I entries
* Adding -L and -l entries 
* Adding classes to global (define_class)
* Adding modules
* Adding methods to modules (define_module_function)
* Adding classes to modules / other classes (define_class_under)
* Adding methods to classes (.define_method)
* Adding classes to classes (ad infinitum)
* Look into file naming when dealing with Modules
* Nested Modules
* Recognizing and building to_ruby / from_ruby methods for const type references
* Moving the to_ruby / from_ruby definitions to a place that all will know about them
* Enumerations
* Proper TypesManager dealings with single_file writer mode

No longer waiting on rice - just building a wrapper myself now.
