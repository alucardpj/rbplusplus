Parts to move into rbgccxml:

- Class purely_virtual? (check the abstract attribute)
- Namespace#methods ?

Seen in Ogre.rb
- method wrapping is finding a reference when should be a pointer (Ogre::ShadowTextureManager::getSingleton)

Move documentation to YARD?

Use sdoc?

Logging:
 - Method overloads, wrap what a method is getting named as
 - More detail into the writing, multiple and single file writers
 - More debug messages in the building process
