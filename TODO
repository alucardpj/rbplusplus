- Single file writer mode is nondeterministically broken. Need to ensure that types are defined in the appropriate order (base calsses before subclasses, etc).

- Rewrite the code generation system. It's gotten really messy and needs to be redesigned.

List of current tests and a marking of which ones work, which are broken, and which are in progress.
