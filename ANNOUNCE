Announcing the rb++ / rbgccxml Ruby extension generation framework!

For anyone who wants an alternative to SWIG for generating Ruby extensions from C++ header files, look no further. 

== Project

Documentation: http://rbplusplus.rubyforge.org

Project Page: http://rubyforge.org/projects/rbplusplus

== Installation

This single command will grab the whole stack needed for rb++ to work.

  gem install rbplusplus

The stack includes three libraries: rb++, rbgccxml, and gccxml_gem

== rb++

Rb++ makes it almost trivially easy to create Ruby extensions for any C or C++ library / code. In the simplest of cases, there is no need to ever touch C, everything is done in a very simple and clean Ruby API.

As this is an 0.1 release, not all of C++ is supported. The current constructs that rb++ can wrap are:

* functions
* classes
* class methods
* static class methods

Rb++ allows one to define Ruby Modules and put wrapped code in them as well.

== rbgccxml

RbGCCXML allows one to easily parse out and query C++ code. This library uses GCC-XML to parse out the C++ code into XML, and then Hpricot to parse and query that XML.

== gccxml_gem

GCC-XML (www.gccxml.org) is an application that takes takes the parse tree of G++ and constructs a very parsable and queryable XML file with all related information. 

The third part of the stack is this gem that includes a binary build of GCC-XML for your platform, to make it trivially easy to install. Platforms currently supported are:

* Linux 32 & 64 bit
* Mac OS X
* Windows 32-bit via Cygwin

== Requirements

* rice (http://rice.rubyforge.org) - The C++ interface for Ruby
* hpricot (http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/hpricot/) - Does the XML parsing
* test/spec - For running the tests

== Code

All code is hosted at github

rb++: http://github.com/jameskilton/rbplusplus/tree/master
rbgccxml: http://github.com/jameskilton/rbgccxml/tree/master
gccxml_gem: http://github.com/jameskilton/gccxml_gem/tree/master

== Notes

Released under the MIT licence.

For those familiar with py++ / pygccxml, the similarities are in function only. Rb++ / rbgccxml were written from scratch to take advantage of the Ruby language to it's fullest.

Bugs, patches, feature requests, et al should be posted to the project's tracker.

Discussion can be here or the project's rubyforge forums.

== CHANGELOG

=== 0.1.1

* rb++: Added rice as a gem dependency
* all: Added ldflags / cxxflags options for passing in other custom command line arguments
* gccxml: Error message about how to fix the file execution flags is now consistent across platforms.
