= What is rb++ / rbgccxml?

For anyone who wants an alternative to SWIG for generating Ruby extensions for C++ libraries, look no further.

== Project

Documentation: http://rbplusplus.rubyforge.org

Project Page: http://rubyforge.org/projects/rbplusplus

== Installation

This single command will grab the whole stack needed for rb++ to work.

  gem install rbplusplus

The stack includes three libraries: rb++, rbgccxml, and gccxml_gem and will install rice

== rb++

Rb++ makes it almost trivially easy to create Ruby extensions for C++ library. In the simplest of cases, there is no need to ever touch C++, everything is done in a very simple and clean Ruby API.

== rbgccxml

RbGCCXML allows one to easily parse out and query C / C++ code. This library uses GCC-XML to parse out the C / C++ code into XML, and then libxml-ruby to parse and query that XML.

== gccxml_gem

GCC-XML (www.gccxml.org) is an application that takes takes the parse tree of C / C++ and constructs a very parsable and queryable XML file with all related information.

The third part of the stack is this gem that includes a binary build of GCC-XML for your platform, to make it trivially easy to install. Platforms currently supported are:

* Linux 32 & 64 bit
* Mac OS X
* Windows 32-bit via Cygwin

== Requirements

* rice (http://rice.rubyforge.org)
* libxml-ruby (http://libxml.rubyforge.org/)
* test/spec

== Code

== Notes

Released under the MIT licence.

For those familiar with py++ / pygccxml, the similarities are in function only. Rb++ / rbgccxml were written from scratch to take advantage of the Ruby language to it's fullest.

Bugs, patches, feature requests, et al should be posted to the corresponding project's Issues page on github.

Discussion can be here or the project's rubyforge forums.
