= What is rb++ / rbgccxml?

Rb++, rbgccxml, and rice compose a suite of tools that make wrapping C++ libraries into
Ruby extensions as simple as possible. This is built as a replacement for SWIG-Ruby.

== Project

Documentation: http://rbplusplus.rubyforge.org

Project Pages:

  rb++:     http://github.com/jameskilton/rbplusplus
  rbgccxml: http://github.com/jameskilton/rbgccxml

== Installation

This single command will grab the whole stack needed for rb++ to work.

  gem install rbplusplus

The stack includes four libraries: rb++, rbgccxml, gccxml_gem, and rice

== rb++

Rb++ makes it almost trivially easy to create Ruby extensions for C++ library. In the simplest of cases, there is no need to ever touch C++, everything is done in a very simple and clean Ruby API.

== rbgccxml

RbGCCXML allows one to easily parse out and query C / C++ code. This library uses GCC-XML to parse out the C / C++ code into XML, and then libxml-ruby to parse and query that XML.

== gccxml_gem

GCC-XML (www.gccxml.org) is an application that takes takes the parse tree of C / C++ and constructs a very parsable and queryable XML file with all related information.

This gem includes a binary build of GCC-XML for supported platforms, to make it trivially easy to install. Platforms currently supported are:

* Linux 32 & 64 bit
* Mac OS X
* Windows via Cygwin

== Rice

The Ruby Interface for C++ Extensions, it provides a C++ API for working with ruby. More information
available at its project page:

  http://rice.rubyforge.org

== Other Libraries

* libxml-ruby (http://libxml.rubyforge.org/)
* test/spec

== Notes

Released under the MIT licence.

For those familiar with py++ / pygccxml, the similarities are in function only. Rb++ / rbgccxml were written from scratch to take advantage of the Ruby language to it's fullest.

Bugs, patches, feature requests, et al should be posted to the corresponding project's Issues page on github.
