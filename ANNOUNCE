What is rb++ / rbgccxml?

  Rb++, rbgccxml, and rice compose a suite of tools that make wrapping C++ libraries into
  Ruby extensions as simple as possible. This is built as a replacement for SWIG-Ruby.

What's New

  * Full 1.9 support through the entire stack!
  * MinGW / MSYS build support on Windows.

  rb++:
    * Updated to work with the Rice::Director changes
    * Fixed a bug where rb++ wasn't using any superclass on classes with multiple superclasses
    * Generated extension handles exceptions cleaner
    * Various other small bug fixes and tweaks

  rbgccxml:
    * Switched parsing from libxml-ruby to nokogiri
    * Fixed crash on encountering <Union>, but no real handling of the type yet.
    * Fixed a bug with older gcc versions on dealing with anonymous enumerations

Installation

  This single command will grab the whole stack needed for rb++ to work.

    gem install rbplusplus

  The stack includes four libraries: rb++, rbgccxml, gccxml_gem, and rice


rb++

  Rb++ makes it almost trivially easy to create Ruby extensions for C++ library.
  In the simplest of cases, there is no need to ever touch C++, everything is done
  in a very simple and clean Ruby API.


rbgccxml

  RbGCCXML allows one to easily parse out and query C / C++ code.
  This library uses GCC-XML to parse out the C / C++ code into XML, and then nokogiri
  to parse and query that XML.


gccxml_gem

  GCC-XML (www.gccxml.org) is an application that takes takes the parse tree of C / C++
  and constructs a very parsable and queryable XML file with all related information.

  This gem includes a binary build of GCC-XML for supported platforms,
  to make it trivially easy to install. Platforms currently supported are:

    * Linux 32 & 64 bit
    * Mac OS X
    * Windows via MinGW / MSYS


Rice

  The Ruby Interface for C++ Extensions, it provides a C++ API for working with ruby. More information
  available at its project page:

Notes

  Released under the MIT licence.

  For those familiar with py++ / pygccxml, the similarities are in function only.
  Rb++ / rbgccxml were written from scratch to take advantage of the Ruby language to it's fullest.

  Bugs, patches, feature requests, et al should be posted to the corresponding project's Issues page on github.
