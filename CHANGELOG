== 0.2

=== rbgccxml

* More GCCXML types implemented. Added ReferenceType, CvQualifiedType, Enumeration / EnumValue. 
* Now caches the current XML parsing. Significant speed boost.
* Can now search for C++ nodes by either single name or fully qualified name

=== rb++

* When printing out types, properly prints out a fully qualified type name (e.g. std::string instead of just string).
* Generates to_ruby definitions for const return types.
* Better placement of generated code when dealing with multiple files. 
* Able to now specify other C/C++ source files to add to the compile step.
* Properly wrapping and exposing enumerations

== 0.1.1

* rb++: Added rice as a gem dependency
* rb++: explicitly requiring fileutils now
* all: Added ldflags / cxxflags options for passing in other custom
command line arguments
* gccxml: Error message about how to fix the file execution flags is
now consistent across platforms.
